# Motivation

Unlike a lot of games, getting into Isaac modding is quite difficult. However, the difficulty doesn’t come from the coding aspect but rather the lack of resources geared towards those who wants to get into modding.

Most modding tutorials were made prior to Repentance coming out. While the core concepts of said tutorials do remain the same for the most part, the code and practices taught hold up poorly due to the numerous changes made to the modding API with the release of the Repentance DLC. As a result of this, there are very few tutorials for Repentance modding. 

With this guidebook, the goal is to teach you how to mod the game in the simplest yet effective way. By the end of this, you should (hopefully) be able to start creating mods on your own!

# Overview

This guidebook goes over almost everything pertaining to Isaac modding. This includes replacing sprites, coding items, coding enemies, and much more.

Contrary to the name, this guidebook is more of a technical one. It does not teach you how to sprite or how to animate. If you were planning on doing them only, this guidebook is not for you. The guidebook is split into multiple different chapters, with each chapter split into multiple different sections.

At the end of each chapter is a short quiz to test your knowledge. If you miss a question on the quiz, reread the chapter to figure out how you answered incorrectly so you can learn from your mistake.

# Required Tools

To get started with modding, you only need two things:

* A copy of [The Binding of Isaac: Repentance](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1426300/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Repentance/)
   * You can't mod the game beyond resource replacements if you own the game on a console (i.e: Switch, PS4) 
   * If you own Afterbirth+, some of the topics covered in this guide may not work due to the changes Repentance made to the modding API
   * If you do not own Afterbirth+ or Repentance, you can not mod the game as there is no modding API 
* An **Integrated Development Environment** (**IDE**) of your Choice. Some options include:
   * ✨ [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   * [ZeroBrane Studio](https://studio.zerobrane.com/)
   * [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)

> ✨ It is highly reccomended to go with Visual Studio Code due to its powerful tooling as well as an [amazing extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Filloax.isaac-lua-api-vscode) which provides autocomplete and some linting. This guidebook will assume you are using Visual Studio Code, although it still possible to follow along if you go with another IDE.
